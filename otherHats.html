		<h2>Art based education</h2>
			<div class="accordion_contents">
				<div class="innerwrapper">
					<p>I am a seasoned arts-based educator and facilitator, having worked in diverse communities in both Canada and Japan. </p>

					<p>Why utilize arts approaches?</p>
	
					<p>Simply because art is an excellent medium to access and explore our curiosity. The conventional classroom setting with linear education approaches does not work for many. Arts-based approaches let us learn through our creativity and im
					agine, something we all have access to. </p>
				
					<h3>My arts-based education is grounded in the following principles</h3>

		<h2>Digital storytelling</h2>
		<div class="accordion_contents">
			<div class="innerwrapper">
				<p>I am a highly skilled digital storytelling facilitator, having led work using this modality for 7 years.</p> 

				<p>Digital stories are typically 2 to 5 minutes in length, feature a first person narrative crated with video, photographs, illustration and other artistic mediums. The intention of the digital stories that I have supported people creating are focused on authentic voice. </p><br/>

				<p>I have led workshops for groups and individuals, supporting their creation of digital stories over the course of 24 hours (spread over several days or weeks). My primary intention and approach is create the space for participants to find their voice, telling a powerful authentic story, learning technical and storytelling skills along the way. I support participants in all aspects of creation, from conceptualization all the way through. </p></br>

				<p>In my 7 years of leading digital storytelling workshops, I have had the honour of working with and supporting individuals from various diverse communities. I have worked, with integrity, to support newcomer, immigrant and refugee communities; LGBTQ+ communities; youth; women; individuals with intersecting identities. </p></br>

				<p>Projects that I have supported include: </p>
